- name: Making 2D-3D corresponding points by capturing Ground Truth Boxes
  url: https://github.com/myVisio/gtPointGenerator
  description: To Calibrate multiple cameras, relative positions should be revealed in terms of absolute position. This can be solved by capturing the already known ground truth object. By matching a pair of features between the ground truth image and captured image, 2D-3D corresponding points offer the 3D ground truth point of 2D.
